This is food ordering website built on Django, a powerful Python framework, that has the potential to transform the way people order food online. I have implemented a robust email verification system. This ensures that users' accounts are protected and helps maintain the security for ordering process. Additionally, users have the ability to effortlessly track their order history and make updates or deletions to their ordered items.
